## Steghide
### PROJECT OVERVIEW
In today's interconnected and data-driven world, the need for secure data transfer and confidential communication is more critical than ever before. As the digital landscape evolves, so do the challenges related to protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access, interception, or tampering. This project titled "StegHide" is an intuitive Web app which aims to create a versatile web application that seamlessly combines the power of image steganography and a secure chat module, providing users with a comprehensive platform to exchange messages and transfer data covertly while maintaining the utmost data integrity and confidentiality.

With the proliferation of online communication and data sharing, there is a growing demand for tools and platforms that prioritize privacy and security. The core objective of this project is to meet this demand by developing a web application that empowers users to interact securely and discreetly, utilizing cutting-edge technologies in the realm of steganography and encryption.

By integrating image steganography techniques, the application allows users to hide data within innocuous images, rendering it virtually invisible to anyone not privy to the decryption keys. Simultaneously, a robust chat module facilitates real-time communication between users, ensuring that sensitive messages are shielded from prying eyes through end-to-end encryption.
                
 This web application that combines image steganography with a secure chat module, user-friendly interface for secure communication and data transfer and strong data protection mechanisms ensuring.           
confidentiality and integrity.

  Developed with HTML, CSS, REACT JS for the Front-End, and backed by NODE JS and FIREBASE for Database for the Back-End, it ensures reliable and secure communication between the users.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
